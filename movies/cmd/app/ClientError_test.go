The `clientError` function is defined in the Go file `helpers.go` under the `main` package. The function takes two parameters: a `http.ResponseWriter` to write the error message, and an `int` denoting the HTTP status code. It uses the `http.Error` function to send a client error with a corresponding status text based on the provided status code.

Here are the Golang testing scenarios structured as per your request:

```plaintext
Scenario 1: Regular operation with common client error status code

Details:
  Description: Testing the clientError function using a typical HTTP client error status code (400 - Bad Request).
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock or simulate the http.ResponseWriter to capture its output.
  Act: Call clientError with the mocked ResponseWriter and a status code of 400.
  Assert: Use Go's testing framework to check that the ResponseWriter received a 400 status code and the appropriate status message ("Bad Request").
Validation:
  Justify: A 400 status code is often used to indicate that the request cannot be processed due to client error (bad request). The reason for expecting "Bad Request" is that it is the defined HTTP status message for error code 400.
  Importance: Essential for ensuring clientError correctly handles standard HTTP client errors, helps in building reliable client-server communication.

Scenario 2: Edge case with an undefined HTTP status code

Details:
  Description: Testing the clientError function with an undefined HTTP status code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ResponseWriter.
  Act: Call clientError with a status code that does not correspond to any defined HTTP status messages (e.g., 499).
  Assert: Verify that the response defaults to printing the status code with no specific message.
Validation:
  Justify: By using a non-standard status code, we can test the function's ability to handle unexpected statuses that may not have a predefined text.
  Importance: Validates robustness of the clientError function in abnormal scenarios, ensuring graceful handling of unknown status codes.

Scenario 3: Using a client error status code at the higher boundary

Details:
  Description: Testing the clientError function with the highest defined client error status code (499 - Client Closed Request, if recognized).
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ResponseWriter.
  Act: Call clientError with a status code of 499.
  Assert: Check that ResponseWriter outputs a 499 status and the appropriate message if defined, or verify error handling if the status is not recognized.
Validation:
  Justify: Testing boundary values ensures that the function operates correctly across the full range of expected input values.
  Importance: Critical for ensuring that the function behaves correctly at the boundary of client error status codes, which may be useful for handling specific cases like prematurely closed client requests.

```

Each scenario ensures coverage from typical use cases, edge cases, and boundary tests which are crucial for comprehensive verification of the `clientError` function in various real-world and exceptional circumstances.
