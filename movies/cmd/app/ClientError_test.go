Scenario 1: Testing the function with a valid HTTP status code
- Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the `clientError` function when provided with a valid HTTP status code such as 404.
- Execution:
    - Arrange: Prepare a mock HTTP response writer and a status code (e.g. 404).
    - Act: Invoke `clientError` with the mock response writer and the status code.
    - Assert: Check that the HTTP response writer's output is as expected. For HTTP 404, `http.StatusText(status)` should be `"Not Found"`.
- Validation: 
    - The chosen assertion is based on how `clientError` is designed to work, meaning it should set the error message of the response writer to the string representation of the status. 
    - This test is important because it checks whether the function performs as expected with valid input.

Scenario 2: Testing the function with an invalid HTTP status code
- Description: This test checks the behavior of the function when provided with an invalid HTTP status code. An example of an invalid status code can be any negative integer or 0.
- Execution:
    - Arrange: Arrange a mock HTTP response writer and an invalid status code (e.g. `-1` or `0`).
    - Act: Invoke `clientError` function with the mock response writer and the status code.
    - Assert: Check that the HTTP response writer's output is as expected. Which in this case should be `"Unknown Status"`
- Validation: 
    - The chosen assertion is based on the fact that `http.StatusText` function returns `"Unknown Status"` for invalid status codes. 
    - It is important to test this edge case to ensure that the application handles invalid or unexpected inputs gracefully. 

Scenario 3: Testing the function with a less common valid HTTP status code
- Description: This test checks how `clientError` behaves when provided with a less commonly used but valid HTTP status code (e.g. 418).
- Execution:
    - Arrange: Prepare a mock HTTP response writer and a less common but valid status code (e.g. `418`).
    - Act: Invoke `clientError` with the mock response writer and the less common status code.
    - Assert: Check that the HTTP response writer's output is as expected, which in case of `418` should be "I'm a teapot".
- Validation:
    - The chosen assertion is based on how `clientError` is designed to work. It should set the error message of the response writer to string representation of the status, even for less common status codes.
    - This test is important to ensure that the function can handle less common but valid HTTP status codes correctly.
