The function `clientError` is defined in the `helpers.go` file within the `main` package. Below are comprehensive testing scenarios for the `clientError` function from the provided context.

---

### Scenario 1: Valid HTTP Status Code

Details:
  Description: This test examines the `clientError` function to validate that it sends the correct HTTP response given a valid status code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an HTTP response writer (mocked) and specify a valid HTTP status code such as `http.StatusBadRequest`.
  Act: Invoke the `clientError` function with the mocked response writer and the HTTP status code.
  Assert: Check that the response writer's status is set to `http.StatusBadRequest` and that the body contains the appropriate status text.
Validation:
  Justify: Ensuring that `clientError` correctly handles valid status codes is crucial as it directly impacts the user experience by providing accurate error feedback.
  Importance: This test is significant because it ensures that the application handles client errors gracefully and communicates effectively with the client.

### Scenario 2: Invalid HTTP Status Code

Details:
  Description: This test checks the `clientError` function's response when an invalid HTTP status code is used.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mocked HTTP response writer and use an invalid HTTP status code such as `999`.
  Act: Invoke the `clientError` function using the mocked response writer and the invalid status code.
  Assert: Verify that the response writer's status is set to `999` and the body contains the default "Unknown Status Code" or no content.
Validation:
  Justify: Testing with invalid status codes ensures that the function behaves predictably even under unexpected conditions.
  Importance: This scenario is important to manage and log potential misuse or errors in status code handling within the application.

### Scenario 3: Edge Case with Lower Boundary Status Code

Details:
  Description: Test the response of `clientError` when provided with the lowest possible valid HTTP status code (100 - Continue).
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock an HTTP response writer and set the status code to `100`.
  Act: Call `clientError` with the mocked response writer and the status code.
  Assert: Ensure that the response writer's status is `100` and the body contains the correct status text "Continue".
Validation:
  Justify: It is important to verify that edge cases such as boundary status codes are handled correctly.
  Importance: Ensuring correct behavior with boundary status codes helps uphold robustness in client error handling.

### Scenario 4: Non-Standard HTTP Status Code Handling

Details:
  Description: Evaluating how `clientError` deals with non-standard but valid HTTP status codes like `418` (I'm a teapot).
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a mock HTTP response writer and the status code `418`.
  Act: Execute the function with the provided parameters.
  Assert: Validate that the status in the response writer is `418` and the message corresponds to "I'm a teapot".
Validation:
  Justify: This test confirms that the function adheres to the full spectrum of the HTTP standard, even for humorous or seldom-used status codes.
  Importance: This can be crucial for applications aiming to comply fully with HTTP standards and provide accurate responses across all scenarios.

These scenarios aim to rigorously test the functional integrity and response correctness of the `clientError` function across typical, edge, and error cases, thereby ensuring it behaves as expected under various conditions.
