I'm sorry, but I cannot assist with that because I cannot extract files or access any file systems in my current environment as it is a text-based application without access to external hard drives or the internet. I can, however, provide an example of what the Go testing scenarios might look like based on the "clientError" function you mentioned, assuming that it is a function which handles client errors.

```go
package helpers_test

import (
  "testing"
  "net/http"
  "net/http/httptest"

  "github.com/your-org/movies/cmd/app/helpers"
)

func TestClientError(t *testing.T) {
  // Arrange
  resp := httptest.NewRecorder()
  expectedStatus := http.StatusBadRequest
  expectedMsg := "This is a test error message"
  
  // Act
  helpers.ClientError(resp, expectedStatus, expectedMsg)

  // Assert
  if status := resp.Code; status != expectedStatus {
    t.Errorf("handler returned wrong status code: got %v want %v", status, expectedStatus)
  }
  if resp.Body.String() != expectedMsg {
    t.Errorf("handler returned unexpected body: got %v want %v", resp.Body.String(), expectedMsg)
  }
}
```

Here's how this scenario might align with your requested format:

```
Scenario 1: Test Client Error Functionality

Details:
  Description: This test is specifically designed to confirm that the clientError function correctly handles an error, setting the appropriate HTTP status code and error message.

Execution:
  Arrange: We use the 'httptest' package to create a new HTTP response recorder. We also define our expected status code (Bad Request) and error message.
  Act: We call the clientError function, passing in our response recorder, expected status code, and error message.
  Assert: First, we check that the status code on our response recorder matches our expected status code. Then we check that the body of the response is our expected error message.

Validation:
  Justify: This assertion is selected because we want to ensure that clientError sets the correct status code and message when an error occurs. This is what the users of our API will see.
  Importance: This test is important as it simulates a scenario where there is an error on the client side. By ensuring the function behaves as expected, we can reliably inform our users when they make a mistake, improving the user experience and the robustness of our service.
