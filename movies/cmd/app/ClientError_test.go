Scenario 1: Test with standard HTTP Status Code
  Details:
    Description: This test is to verify that when a valid HTTP status code is supplied, the `clientError` method correctly sets the HTTP response code and returns the associated status text.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the `ResponseWriter` and prepare a valid HTTP status code say `http.StatusNotFound`.
    Act: Invoke the `clientError` function with the prepared status code.
    Assert: Verify that `http.Error()` is invoked with the mocked `ResponseWriter`, status text and status code from `http.StatusText()`.
  Validation:
    The test is supposed to assert that the http status code and associated status text set are as expected. This falls well into ensuring the function behaves expectedly under normal operation. It's important as the function seemingly serves the purpose of setting the HTTP code and response for client errors.

Scenario 2: Test with custom HTTP Status Code
  Details:
    Description: This test aims to check how the `clientError` function behaves when given a non-standard HTTP status code.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the `ResponseWriter` and prepare a non-standard or invalid HTTP status code say `450`.
    Act: Invoke the `clientError` function with the prepared status code.
    Assert: Verify that `http.Error()` is invoked with the mocked `ResponseWriter`, status text and status code from `http.StatusText()`.
  Validation:
    By specifying a non-standard HTTP status code, we assert if the `clientError` handles such situations correctly. It provides an understanding of how the function works when dealing with edge cases i.e., any unrecognized or invalid HTTP status code.

Scenario 3: Test with zero-valued HTTP Status Code
  Details:
    Description: This test is to ensure the function properly handles a call with a zero-valued status code which is an invalid code.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the `ResponseWriter` and prepare a zero-valued HTTP status code.
    Act: Invoke the `clientError` function with the prepared status code.
    Assert: Verify that `http.Error()` is invoked with the mocked `ResponseWriter`, status text and status code from `http.StatusText()`.
  Validation:
    The test scenario checks how the `clientError` function reacts with no HTTP status code (or invalid HTTP status code). This falls under the test of behaviour under erroneous conditions, thus considering it as an important boundary case. This test might be important for understanding how the function works with no or invalid HTTP status code.
