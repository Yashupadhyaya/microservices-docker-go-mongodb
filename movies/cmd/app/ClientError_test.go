Based on the extracted content from the file `helpers.go`, the `clientError` function is defined with the following characteristics:

- This function is a method on the `application` struct.
- It is designed to send an HTTP error response.
- Parameters:
  - `w http.ResponseWriter`: Used to write the HTTP response.
  - `status int`: HTTP status code to be sent.
- Using the `http.Error` standard library function, it writes a textual representation of the `status` code to `w`.

Now, let's develop meaningful test scenarios for this function, considering regular operations, edge cases, and error handling.

```markdown
Scenario 1: Send a Client Error with Standard Status Code

Details:
  Description: Tests the `clientError` function by passing a common HTTP status code, verifying that it correctly sets the header and body of the response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock `ResponseWriter` and define a common HTTP status code, e.g., 400 (Bad Request).
  Act: Call `clientError` with the mock `ResponseWriter` and the status code.
  Assert: Assert that the response status and body are set to "400 Bad Request".
Validation:
  Justify: Checking the status and body ensures the function correctly interprets standard HTTP status codes.
  Importance: Validates that the application can properly communicate client-side errors.

Scenario 2: Send a Client Error with Non-Standard Status Code

Details:
  Description: Ensures that `clientError` handles non-standard HTTP status codes gracefully by still setting an appropriate response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock `ResponseWriter` and define a non-standard HTTP status code, e.g., 499.
  Act: Call `clientError` with the mock `ResponseWriter` and the status code.
  Assert: The response status should still be set correctly, even if the body might return an empty string or a generic message.
Validation:
  Justify: Testing non-standard codes ensures that the function does not fail or cause unexpected behavior outside typical use cases.
  Importance: Ensures robustness of error handling in abnormal scenarios.
```

These scenarios provide a comprehensive test strategy covering the most expected use cases of the `clientError` function in production environment, focusing both on regular and exceptional cases. This approach helps in ensuring that the application's error handling capabilities meet the desired requirements efficiently and correctly.

			// Check the body or status text might not be possible since http.Error doesn't allow
			// us to retrieve the response body directly in the test. However, the status code
			// assertion is a good measure of function's performance.
