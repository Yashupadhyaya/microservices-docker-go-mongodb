Scenario 1: Client Error with valid status code

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the `clientError` function correctly applies the status code and its corresponding text to the http error response.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of application struct will be created and a mock ResponseWriter will be created to handle the response.
  Act: Invoke the `clientError` method of the application instance with a valid HTTP status code (for example http.StatusBadRequest).
  Assert: Check if the Status code and the content of the response matches the expected status text.
Validation:
  Assertion is made on the status code and text to ensure that they match the expected outcomes. This choice of assertion is crucial to ensure that the error displayed to the users is corresponding to the actual HTTP status.
  It is important as the correct client error message can aid in debugging and user understanding of the issue at hand.

Scenario 2: Client Error with invalid status code

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the `clientError` function handles an invalid status code.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of application struct will be created and a mock ResponseWriter will be created.
  Act: Invoke the `clientError` method of the application instance with an invalid HTTP status code (for example 9001).
  Assert: Check if the Status code and the content of the response matches to a generic 'unknown' or 'invalid' status text, and not the exact number provided.
Validation:
  Assertion is verifying that the content of the response doesn't match the invalid status code passed on to the clientError function.
  This test is crucial to ensure that invalid status codes are not exposed to the end user, and rather a more human-friendly message is displayed.

Scenario 3: Client Error with no status code

Details:
  Description: This test checks how the `clientError` function handles when no status code is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of application struct will be created and a mock ResponseWriter will be created.
  Act: Invoke the `clientError` method of the application instance with a status code of 0.
  Assert: Check if the Status code and the content of the response don't return an HTTP status text that corresponds to an actual status code.
Validation:
  Asserting here that the response does not contain a valid HTTP status text string. Providing a status code of 0 might lead to unknown behaviours. This test ensures that no invalid outputs are given to the user which could be misleading.
  This is important as it helps to prevent any potential issues or bugs which might occur when no status code is provided.
