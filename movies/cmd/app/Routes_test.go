Scenario 1: Test successful GET request to /api/movies/
  
  Details:
    Description: This is to test the case where client initiates a successful GET request to the "/api/movies/" endpoint.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock *application and set up a mock http.Get() request to "/api/movies/".
    Act: Call the routes() method of the mock *application and execute the handler attached to the GET request.
    Assert: Assert that the returned http response is 200 OK.

  Validation:
    This test scenario validates that the GET request to "/api/movies/" endpoint triggers the correct handler function. It is important to verify the correct working of HTTP routes in API development for proper functioning.

Scenario 2: Test successful GET request to /api/movies/{id}
  
  Details:
    Description: This is to test the case where client attempts to retrieve a movie by its ID.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock *application and set up a mock http.Get() request to "/api/movies/{id}".
    Act: Call the routes() method of the mock *application and execute the handler attached to the GET request.
    Assert: Assert that the returned http response is 200 OK and has corresponding movie data.

  Validation:
    The test checks whether the application returns the correct movie details for a given ID. It is crucial to test this for maintaining data integrity and to ensure that the correct information is transmitted to requesting clients.

Scenario 3: Test successful POST request to /api/movies/
  
  Details:
    Description: This is to test the case where client initiates a successful POST request to the "/api/movies/" endpoint.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock *application and set up a mock http.Post() request to "/api/movies/" with random movie data.
    Act: Call the routes() method of the mock *application and execute the handler attached to the POST request.
    Assert: Assert that the returned http response is 200 OK or 201 Created, and that the server is updating with new movie detail.

  Validation:
    This tests the POST route handler in the application. POST routes are crucial in maintaining data on the server side as they facilitate the creation of new resources.

Scenario 4: Test successful DELETE request to /api/movies/{id}
  
  Details:
    Description: This is to test the case where client initiates a successful DELETE request to the "/api/movies/{id}" endpoint.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock *application and set up a mock http.Delete() request to "/api/movies/{id}" with a valid movie ID.
    Act: Call the routes() method of the mock *application and execute the handler attached to the DELETE request.
    Assert: Assert that the returned http response is 200 OK or 204 No Content, and that the server actually deleted the specified movie.

  Validation:
    This tests the DELETE route handler in the application. DELETE routes provide ways to remove resources from the server, so their correctness is crucial to prevent unintended data loss.

Scenario 5: Test 404 Not Found status 

  Details:
    Description: This is to test the case where client initiates a GET request to an undefined endpoint.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock *application and set up a mock http.Get() request to an undefined endpoint.
    Act: Call the routes() method of the mock *application and execute the handler attached to the irrelevant GET request.
    Assert: Assert that the returned http response is 404 Not Found.

  Validation:
    This scenario tests the NotFoundHandler in the router. The NotFoundHandler must respond to undefined routes and methods with a standard HTTP 404 Not Found status code to prevent information leak about the server's internal structure.
