Scenario 1: Testing Successful GET Request for All Movies
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to verify that the routes function contains a route that will successfully handle a GET request to /api/movies/ to fetch all movies in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: We will need to mock the app.all function call and set it to return a predefined response.
  Act: We will call the routes function and make a GET request to /api/movies/.
  Assert: We will use Go's HTTP testing facilities to check the status code of the response and whether it matches the expected success status code (200).
Validation:
  The assertion is checking that the HTTP status code is 200 OK because this indicates a successful request. This test covers a core feature of the application which is to fetch all movies; hence its importance.

Scenario 2: Testing Successful GET Request for Single Movie
Details:
  Description: The test verifies that the routes function correctly handles a GET request to /api/movies/{id}, fetching a specific movie by its ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Need to mock the app.findByID function call. Placeholder {id} should be replaced by a specific predefined movie ID.
  Act: Call the routes function and make a GET request to /api/movies/{id}.
  Assert: Use Go's HTTP testing facilities to check the status code of the response and match it with the expected success status code (200).
Validation:
  It's crucial in ensuring that the system is correctly fetching a single movie by its ID, a core functionality of this application. 

Scenario 3: Testing Successful POST Request for Adding New Movie
Details:
  Description: The test ensures that the routes function can handle a POST request to /api/movies/ to insert a new movie.
Execution:
  Arrange: Need to mock the app.insert function call and the new movie data.
  Act: Call the routes function and make a POST request to /api/movies/ with the new movie data.
  Assert: Check the status code of the response and verify that it matches the expected success status code (201).
Validation:
  This test verifies that we can insert a new movie into the database, a fundamental ability of this application.

Scenario 4: Testing Successful DELETE Request for a Movie
Details:
  Description: Test verifies that the routes function correctly handles a DELETE request to /api/movies/{id}, deleting a specific movie by its ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Need to mock the app.delete function and a specific predefined movie ID.
  Act: Call the routes function and make a DELETE request to /api/movies/{id}.
  Assert: Check the status code of the response and verify it matches the expected status code for successful deletion (204).
Validation:
  This is important in making sure the system is properly deleting a movie by its ID, a key part of managing the movie database. 

Scenario 5: Invalid Route Request
Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the routes function correctly handles a request to an invalid route.
Execution:
  Arrange: An invalid route that does not exist.
  Act: Call the routes function and make a GET request to the non-existing route.
  Assert: Check the status code of the response and verify that it matches the expected status code for Not Found (404).
Validation:
  Ensuring how the application handles invalid or non-existent routes is equally important to ensure stability and provide appropriate user feedback.
