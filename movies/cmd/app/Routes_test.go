As an AI model developed by OpenAI, I'm currently unable to run or directly interact with user files, extract zip files or scan files directly. However, I can provide you with an example of how you might write test scenarios for a Golang function if given the function details, its parameters, behaviour, expected return types, and other relevant information. 

Assuming we're testing a function like the following:

```go
// routes.go

package main

import (
	"github.com/gorilla/mux"
	"net/http"
)

type App struct {
	Router *mux.Router
}

func (a *App) route() {
	a.Router = mux.NewRouter()
	a.Router.HandleFunc("/movies", a.getMovies).Methods("GET")
}

func (a *App) getMovies(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request){
	//...Implementation
}
```

Let's assume that your routes function sets up the routing for your application:

**Scenario 1: Testing if the route '/movies' exists**

_Details:_
  Description: This test examines if the route '/movies' exists after invoking the 'route()' function. 

_Execution:_
  Arrange: We need to initialize our App struct and call the 'route()' function to set up the routes.
  Act: Check whether the '/movies' route is included in the routing table.
  Assert: Use Go's 'if statement' to assert that the '/movies' route exists in the Router.

_Validation:_
  Justify: If the '/movies' route does not exist, it means our route setup is not working correctly, potentially causing failures when the client tries to access this endpoint.
  Importance: This test is important as it ensures that all necessary routes are set up correctly which is required for the application to function correctly. 

Test would look like :

```go
package main

import (
	"reflect"
	"testing"
)

func TestRoutes(t *testing.T) {
	app := App{}
	app.route()
	route := "/movies"
	_, ok := reflect.TypeOf(app.Router).MethodByName(route)
	if !ok {
		t.Fatal("No route found for '/movies'")
	}
}
```

For more complex test scenarios you might also want to consider testing error scenarios and behavior of the targeted function. Keep in mind that you would most likely need to mock your dependencies, like 'getMovies' function that could potentially make a database call to get the movies. 

Hope below example gives you how to write tests for the edge cases and error handling.

```go
package main

import (
	"net/http"
	"net/http/httptest"
	"testing"
)

// Test to check if the correct StatusCode is returned
func TestGetMoviesStatusCode(t *testing.T) {
	app := App{}
	req, err := http.NewRequest("GET", "/movies", nil)
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatal(err)
	}

	responseRecorder := httptest.NewRecorder()
	handler := http.HandlerFunc(app.getMovies)

	handler.ServeHTTP(responseRecorder, req)

	if status := responseRecorder.Code; status != http.StatusOK {
		t.Errorf("handler returned wrong status code: got %v want %v",
			status, http.StatusOK)
	}
}
```

In real world scenarios, these kind of tests would cover a large variety of cases and provide a safety net against potential errors or issues in code.
