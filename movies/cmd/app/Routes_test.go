Scenario 1: Validate Route Mapping for All Movies

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to validate the route mapping for getting all the movies from the database. A successful execution will indicate that route "/api/movies/" for GET method is correctly implemented in routes function.
Execution:
    Arrange: Use a mock for the *mux.Router and *application with app.all function.
    Act: Invoke routes function and check route mapping for "/api/movies/" with GET method.
    Assert: Confirm the route is mapped to the app.all function.
Validation:
    The assertion validates if the route setup is implemented properly. Ensuring the correct route configuration is crucial to the functionality of the service.

Scenario 2: Validate Route Mapping for Fetching Movie by ID

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to validate the route mapping for fetching a single movie from the database given its ID. Successful test confirms the "/api/movies/{id}" for GET method is correctly mapped.
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the *mux.Router and *application with the app.findByID function.
    Act: Invoke routes function and check route mapping for "/api/movies/{id}" with GET method.
    Assert: Verify the route is mapped to the app.findByID function.
Validation:
    The assertion validates that the route setup is implemented correctly, allowing the user to fetch specific movie details.

Scenario 3: Validate Route Mapping for Movie Insertion

Details:
    Description: This test validates the route mapping for inserting a new movie record into the database. It checks whether the route "/api/movies/" for POST method is properly implemented.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock for the *mux.Router and *application with the app.insert function.
    Act: Call routes function and check route mapping for "/api/movies/" with the POST method.
    Assert: Confirm the route is mapped correctly to app.insert function.
Validation:
    The test assertion verifies correct route setup. This route is important for enabling users to add new movie records.

Scenario 4: Validate Route Mapping for Movie Deletion

Details:
    Description: This test validates the route mapping for deleting a movie record. It checks whether the route "/api/movies/{id}" for DELETE method is correctly mapped.
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the *mux.Router and *application with app.delete function.
    Act: Invoke routes function and check route mapping for "/api/movies/{id}" with the DELETE method.
    Assert: Assert that the route is mapped correctly to the app.delete function.
Validation:
    The assertion validates correct route setup, which is important for enabling a user to delete an existing movie record.
