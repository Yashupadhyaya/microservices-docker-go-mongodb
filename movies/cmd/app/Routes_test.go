Since I don't have the ability to extract files or directly access files in your environment, I can provide you general test scenarios for a function named `routes()`. Based on typical Go web server pattern, I assume that `routes()` function is responsible for handling HTTP routes for your application's server and routes every incoming request to its corresponding handler.

Here are some potential scenarios. Each of these scenarios will require the use of a package like `net/http/httptest` to create an HTTP request and recorder.

```go
Scenario 1: Test Correct Routing for Get Movies Endpoint

Details:
  Description: The test checks whether GET request to "/movies" URL is routed to the correct handler (For example the function named `GetMovies()`)
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a GET request to "/movies" endpoint.
  Act: Pass the request through the `routes` function.
  Assert: Check if the request is handled by the handler dedicated for handling "/movies" endpoint.
Validation:
  Justify: If the request handler function is not correctly assigned, the expected operation (like fetching movies from the database) will not be performed.
  Importance: Ensuring the correct routing of requests is critical for application's functionality and user experience.

Scenario 2: Test Correct Routing for Post Movies Endpoint

Details:
  Description: The test checks whether POST request to "/movies" URL is routed to the correct handler (For example the function named `PostMovie()`)
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a POST request to "/movies" endpoint.
  Act: Pass the request through the `routes` function.
  Assert: Check if the request is handled by the handler dedicated for handling "/movies" endpoint for POST method.
Validation:
  Justify: If the request handler function is not correctly assigned, the expected operation (like adding a new movie to the database) will not be performed.
  Importance: Ensuring the correct routing of requests is critical for application's functionality and user experience.

Scenario 3: Test Incorrect or Non-existent Routes

Details:
  Description: The test checks whether a request to an incorrect or non-existent URL is handled correctly (usually by returning 404 error).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a GET request to an incorrect URL(like "/incorrect").
  Act: Pass the request through the `routes` function.
  Assert: Check if the response status code is 404.
Validation:
  Justify: The test validates that application correctly handles invalid requests and returns appropriate status code.
  Importance: Proper error handling ensures stable behavior of the application and enhances user experience by providing proper error messages.
```

You can add the similar test scenarios for all your routes, using different HTTP methods if required. It's important to note that Go's `net/http/httptest` package provides an easy way to test HTTP responses in your application. However, it does not provide a way to directly test if a certain function has been called, so to check if request is routed to a correct handler, you can mock the handler function and assert on the mock.
