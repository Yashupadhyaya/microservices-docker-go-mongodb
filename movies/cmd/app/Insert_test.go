I'm sorry for the confusion, but unfortunately, I am only able to process text requests and execute Python code snippets, and I can't extract files or review non-text file input. I am an AI with no internet access and local file access. However, I can still help you write test scenarios using Go. Below are some example testing scenarios for the function "insert" based on a regular CRUD server using MongoDB:

```Go
package handlers
import (
	"testing"
	"net/http"
	"net/http/httptest"
	"movie"
)
```

For hypothetical function insert:
```Go
func (h *Handlers) insert(res http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	...
}
```

### Scenario 1: Successful Insertion of Movie Details
**Details:**
The test is examining the "insert" function. The scenario it targets is the successful insertion of a movie's details into the MongoDB database.

**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Set up a mocked HTTP request to emulate a user attempting to insert a movie's details. Also, set up a MongoDB mock to simulate successful insertion into the database.
- **Act:** Invoke the "insert" function by passing it the mock request and http response.
- **Assert:** Use Go's testing assertions to check that the mock MongoDB received the expected call to insert the data. Also, assert that the HTTP response has a status code indicating success, such as 200 OK.

**Validation:**
- **Justify:** The reason behind these assertions is that for a successful insert operation, the database needs to be called with the scope of the data, and the user should receive a response indicating success. 
- **Importance:** This test is critical as it checks the main happy path functionality of the function and helps ensure that users can successfully add a movie.

### Scenario 2: Movie Details Insertion Failure Due to Errors From Database
**Details:**
The test is examining the "insert" function, and the scenario it targets involves database errors during the attempt to insert a movie's details.

**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Set up a mocked HTTP request to emulate a user attempting to insert a movie's details. Also, set up a MongoDB mock to simulate a failure scenario when inserting data into the database.
- **Act:** Invoke the "insert" function with the mock request and http response.
- **Assert:** Assert that the mock MongoDB received the expected call, and also assert that the HTTP response indicates an error, such as a status code of 500 Internal Server Error.

**Validation:**
- **Justify:** The reason for these assertions is that when the database encounters an error, the function should return a failure status code. This is to inform the user of the failure in insertion.
- **Importance:** This test is important because it verifies the function's behavior when it encounters a database error. This allows for better error handling and user experience.

Please make sure to replace the function and package names based on your exact requirements. These scenarios are hypothetical examples. The functions signature, package, and imports mentioned are for illustrative purposes.
