Unfortunately, as an AI, I don't have the capability to extract files or read a specific file from a zipped file. However, I can certainly help you to formulate test scenarios, based on your description. Assuming that the function "insert" is defined in the "package main", and takes a MongoDB collection and an instance of a struct type Movie as parameters, and returns an error if there's any, here is how the test scenarios could look like:

```
Scenario 1: Successful Insertion of Movie

Details:
  Description: This test is examining the function "insert" by testing the regular operation of insertion into the database.

Execution:
  Arrange: A mock MongoDB collection and a valid instance of a Movie struct is created.
  Act: The function "insert" is invoked with the mock MongoDB collection and the Movie instance.
  Assert: The returned error should be nil.

Validation:
  Justify: If the insertion is successful, function "insert" is expected to return a nil error.
  Importance: This test validates the main functionality of the "insert" function and ensures that it works as expected under normal conditions.


Scenario 2: Insertion Fails Due to Database Connection Issues

Details:
  Description: This test is examining the function "insert" by testing the scenario where the database connection fails.

Execution:
  Arrange: A faulty mock MongoDB collection (which will simulate a connection failure) and a valid instance of a Movie struct is created.
  Act: The function "insert" is invoked with the faulty mock MongoDB collection and the Movie instance.
  Assert: The returned error should not be nil.

Validation:
  Justify: If the insertion fails due to a database connection issue, function "insert" is expected to return an error.
  Importance: This test ensures that the "insert" function behaves correctly when failing to connect to the database.


Scenario 3: Insertion Fails Due to Invalid Movie Data

Details:
  Description: This test is examining the function "insert" by testing the scenario where invalid movie data is passed.

Execution:
  Arrange: A mock MongoDB collection and an invalid instance of a Movie struct (for example, a Movie with an empty title) is created.
  Act: The function "insert" is invoked with the mock MongoDB collection and the invalid Movie instance.
  Assert: The returned error should not be nil.

Validation:
  Justify: If the insertion fails due to invalid movie data, the function "insert" is expected to return an error.
  Importance: This test ensures the "insert" function behaves correctly when given invalid movie data and helps to maintain data integrity within the database.
