I'm sorry, but without internet access, I can't extract files or view their contents. However, I can certainly guide you on how to build test scenarios for a fictional "insert" function based on the information you've provided.

Assuming that the function `insert` is used to insert movie data into a MongoDB repository, here are some plausible testing scenarios:

```go
package app_test

import (
    "testing"
    "context"
    "github.com/the-package-of-the-service/movies/cmd/app"
    "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)

type mockRepo struct{
    //Mock repo definition goes here
}

func (m mockRepo) Insert(ctx context.Context, movie app.Movie) error {
    // Implement mock Insert here, returning nil for successful insert
    return nil
}

func TestInsert(t *testing.T){
    mockRepo := new(mockRepo)
    ctx := context.TODO()

    handler := app.NewHandler(mockRepo)
    
    movie := app.Movie{
        // Fill this with the requisite Movie data
    }

    error := handler.Insert(ctx, movie)
    assert.Nil(t, error)
}
```

**Scenario 1: Successful Insert Operation**

Details:  
This scenario tests the regular operation of the function insert, specifically, the scenario where the insert operation is successful.
  
Execution:  

Arrange: We create a mock movie repository and a movie instance. Then, we pass the mock repository to the handler.  
Act: Invoke the insert function in the handler, with the movie instance and a context.  
Assert: Assert that the returned error is nil.  

Validation:  
Justify: If the insert operation was successful, we would expect no error to be returned.  
Importance: It's crucial that our insert operation executes properly under normal conditions to meet business requirements.

**Scenario 2: Failed Insert Operation due to Duplicated Movie**

Details:  
This scenario examines how the insert operation handles the insertion of duplicate movie data.

Execution:  

Arrange: Mock the repository such that an error is returned when a movie with existing data is inserted.  
Act: Invoke the insert function, using a movie instance that already exists in the mock repository.  
Assert: Assert that an error is returned.

Validation:  
Justify: Since the movie already exists in the repository, we would expect the insert operation to fail and return an error.  
Importance: This test checks whether the service correctly handles duplicates, fulfilling the requirement of unique movie entries.

You can add more tests like invalid movie data, null movie data, or failed insert operation due to database connection issues based on requirements of your application.
