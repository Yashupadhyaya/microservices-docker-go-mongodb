Scenario 1: Valid error handling

 Details:
   Description: This test is meant to check whether the "serverError" function correctly logs the error message and stack trace to the application's error log, and whether the correct status is set in the http response writer.
 Execution:
   Arrange: Set up a mock "application" struct where the "errorLog" field is set to a logger whose output can be captured for later comparison. Arrange an error variable with a known message.
   Act: Invoke the "serverError" function with the error and a response writer.
   Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the logger output contains both the error message and a stack trace. Verify that the status code on the response writer has been set to http.StatusInternalServerError.
 Validation:
   The choice of assertion is based on the intended function of "serverError": to log detailed error information and set the status code of the response. This test is important in that it ensures the function correctly handles internal server errors, logging detailed information for later analysis and returning the correct error code to the client calling the server.

Scenario 2: Error logging handles nil input

Details:
  Description: This test is to ensure that the "serverError" function gracefully handles a nil error input and still correctly sets the http response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a similar environment as Scenario 1, with an http response writer and a model error which is nil.
  Act: Invoke the "serverError" function with the nil error and check the response writer.
  Assert: Ensure that the logger does not contain any error message but may contain a stack trace. Verify that the status code on the response writer has been set to http.StatusInternalServerError.
  Validation:
  Checking for a nil input is important because it helps us understand how the function behaves when no error message is provided. From the business requirements point of view, this kind of audit is crucial because it causes the ability of the software to handle unexpected scenarios better.  

Scenario 3: Error Message with No Stack Trace

Details:
  Description: This test is to ensure that the "serverError" logs the error message when the debug stack is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a similar environment as mentioned in the first two Scenarios. However, this time ensure that the debug stack is empty.
  Act: Invoke the "serverError" function with a known error and check the logger output.
  Assert: Verify that the logger output contains the error message and doesn't include any stack trace information. Validate that the status is still set to http.StatusInternalServerError.
  Validation:
  It is necessary to verify that this function logs critical errors into the system even when the debug stack is not available. This is vital for troubleshooting potential problems in the system.
