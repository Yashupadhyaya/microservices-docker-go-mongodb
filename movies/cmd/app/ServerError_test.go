Scenario 1: Testing for standard error generation and handling

Details:
  Description: This test scenario checks if the serverError function correctly generates a server error, writes it to app's errorLog and sends an HTTP 500 status code in response. 
Execution:
  Arrange: We need an instance of http.ResponseWriter (which can be mocked using httptest.ResponseRecorder), an error (which can be any standard error), and an instance of *application struct with mock loggers.
  Act: Call the serverError function with the mock http.ResponseWriter and error.
  Assert: Check that the error has been written to the errorLog of the application instance. Also, check that the http.ResponseWriter sent a 500 status code in response.
Validation:
  We check for the error being logged as it ensures that any server error gets logged properly for debugging purposes. Verifying the 500 status code in the response ensures that the function also responds appropriately to the client detailing about internal server failure. Both are important functionalities of a web server.

Scenario 2: Testing the response when nil error is passed

Details:
  Description: This test scenario checks the response of serverError function when a nil error is passed to the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: We need an instance of http.ResponseWriter (same as previous) and an instance of *application struct with mock loggers. For error, we pass nil.
  Act: Call the serverError function with the mock http.ResponseWriter and nil error.
  Assert: Check that no error has been logged to the errorLog of the application instance. However, check that the http.ResponseWriter sends a 500 status code.
Validation:
  We check no error being logged as there was no error given to the function to log. However, checking for a 500 status code ensures that despite no error, the function responds with an internal server error status, which indicates an error in the server, not necessarily with the request itself.

Scenario 3: Testing the stack trace in error logging

Details:
  Description: This test scenario checks if the serverError function logs the stack trace along with error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Same as the previous test scenario.
  Act: Call the serverError function and pass to it the mock http.ResponseWriter and standard error.
  Assert: Check that error log contains the stack trace information.
Validation:
  The check for stack trace ensures that the function captures a snapshot of the current goroutine's stack and logs it for debugging purposes. The stack trace can prove very helpful in tracing the execution path leading to the error condition in the server.
