Scenario 1: Server Error Function Outputs Error Trace correctly

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to verify if the "serverError" function correctly logs error trace when an error occurs. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the function's errorLog.Output call to track the trace passed to it and return nil. Create an instance of *application with the mocked error logger and a http.ResponseWriter to pass to the function.
  Act: Call the serverError function with a standard error passed to it.
  Assert: Check if the trace logged matches the erro's trace.
Validation:
  The error's trace is used in debugging issues. It's important to make sure the correct trace is logged for each error to maintain application stability and aid in debugging errors.

Scenario 2: Server Error Function Writes Response Correctly

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to verify if the correct response is written to the http.ResponseWriter when an error occurs. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the http.ResponseWriter's WriteHeader and Write method to track the response written. Create an instance of *application with these mocks.
  Act: Call the serverError function with a standard error passed to it.
  Assert: Confirm that the response status is http.StatusInternalServerError and the response body is the text corresponding to http.StatusInternalServerError.
Validation:
  When an error occurs, the client must be informed about the issue. It's important that the server responds with the correct status and error message to maintain a good user experience and accurate error reporting.

Scenario 3: Server Error Function Logs Nothing on Null Error

Details:
  Description: This test checks that the function "serverError" does not log a trace if the error passed to it is nil.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the function's errorLog.Output call to track if it's called and return nil. Create an instance of *application with the mocked error logger and a http.ResponseWriter.
  Act: Call the serverError function with a nil error passed to it.
  Assert: Check if the log function was not called.
Validation:
  A nil error means that no error occurred, thus it will be wasteful to log a trace. This is important to avoid unnecessary logs and maintain the sanity of the log files.
  
Scenario 4: Server Error Function Does Not Write Response on Null Error

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function "serverError" does not write any response if the error passed to it is nil.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the http.ResponseWriter's WriteHeader and Write method to track if any response is written. Create an instance of *application with the mock and a nil error.
  Act: Call the serverError function with a nil error.
  Assert: Confirm that no response is written.
Validation:
  Writing a response when no error has occurred can mislead the client into thinking an error occurred when it didnâ€™t. This test ensures the server behavior is accurate and transparent.
