As an AI assistant, I don't have the capability to actually access, extract, or interact with files in a local or cloud file system, including the "microservices-docker-go-mongodb.zip" file you mentioned. My capabilities are only limited to text-based interactions. However, based on your request, I can help give you a general idea on how to structure test scenarios for a generic function named "all" in a Golang program.

Here are some basic scenarios that can be common to most applications

```
Scenario 1: Regular Successful Execution

Details:
  Description: This test will examine the function's normal, successful execution where valid input parameters are given.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initial setup for this test involves preparing valid data which could be actual data or mock data depending on the function's parameters.
  Act: The function would be invoked with the valid data prepared in the previous step.
  Assert: Go's testing functions like 'if !=' could be used to check that the function's return value matches the expected output.

Validation:
  Justify: The equality assertion is needed because for regular execution, the function's output should match our expectation when given valid input data.
  Importance: It's crucial to validate the function's regular execution because this will be the most common scenario in actual usage.

Scenario 2: Empty Input

Details:
  Description: This test will examine what happens when the function is given empty data as input.

Execution:
  Arrange: For this test, the setup involves preparing empty data.
  Act: The function will be invoked with the empty data.
  Assert: Go's testing functions like 'if !=' could be used to check that the function's return value matches the expected value, which could be an error message or some default output.

Validation:
  Justify: The expectation is that the function should handle this error gracefully and return an appropriate output and that's why we would want to validate this.
  Importance: Empty input tests help ensure that the function can handle these edge cases without failing, improving the overall reliability of the application.
```
For generation of test scenarios specific to your application, you or a software developer would need to examine the function's code and determine its expected behaviour based on the parameters it accepts and the results it returns. The 'Arrange, Act, Assert' methodology used in the above examples is a common approach in testing which is also applicable to Golang.
