Apologies for misunderstanding, but in this environment, we're unable to execute steps that involve file extraction, scanning file contents, or identifying function signatures within a .go file since this is a text-based platform with limitations on performing those operations. Nevertheless, I can certainly assist you in creating general test scenarios based on hypothetical input and output of the "all" function, assuming we're working on a Go Web API Service and the "all" function is used to get all the movies' details from a MongoDB collection.

**Scenario 1: Test the return of all records in the database**

Details: 
   Description: The test will validate the ability of the "all" function to successfully query all movie records contained in the MongoDB collection

Execution:
   Arrange: Create a mock of MongoDB that returns a set of movies when queried.
   Act: Invoke the "all" function and capture its response. 
   Assert: Use Go's testing package to check that the returned slice of movie records matches the data we prepared our mock database to return.

Validation:
   Justify: If "all" operates correctly, it should return exactly the data that exists in the database. By comparing the data from the database and the function's result, we can ensure the function is working as expected.
   Importance: This test verifies the essential, expected behavior of the "all" function. This is vital as it forms the basis of the API endpoint's correct operation.

**Scenario 2: Test the function when no records exist in the database**

Details:
   Description: The test aims to validate how the "all" function behaves when there are no records in the MongoDB collection.

Execution:
   Arrange: Mock the MongoDB to return an empty slice when queried.
   Act: Invoke the "all" function and capture its response. 
   Assert: Use Go's testing package to validate that an empty slice is returned by the "all" function.

Validation:
   Justify: An indication of zero records from the DB would mean a zero-length slice from the "all" function.
   Importance: It's crucial to know how the function behaves with no data, which often happens during the initial stages of product use or in test environments.

**Scenario 3: Test the function behaviour when an error occurs while querying the MongoDB**

Details:
   Description: This test scenario checks whether the "all" function handles database errors correctly.

Execution:
   Arrange: Prepare our MongoDB mock to return an error when queried.
   Act: Call the "all" function and monitor any error thrown. 
   Assert: Assert that our test function correctly throws the same error.

Validation:
   Justify: When there's an issue with DB, it's useful for the function to bubble up the error to the caller for further management.
   Importance: This test helps ensure the application can handle and effectively indicate errors to the users, which is paramount for debugging and usability.
