Scenario 1: Valid All Request
Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the normal operation of the all() function when the movies are correctly fetched from the mongodb.MovieModel. This scenario targets situations where there are movies available and the http request and response are set up correctly.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a successful call to mongodb.MovieModel.All() that returns a slice of valid movies. Also, set up the http request and response writer correctly.
    Act: Invoke the all() function.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the http status code is 200 OK, and the content of the response body is the json marshaled movies.
Validation:
    The assertion is chosen to ensure that the http response is correctly set up with appropriate status code and that the slice movies data is correctly marshaled into JSON. This test is important to ensure that when all conditions are ideal, the function behaves as expected.

Scenario 2: Failed All Request Due to MovieModel Error
Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the error handling mechanism when the mongodb.MovieModel.All() fails to fetch data, for example, due to a database connection error.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a situation where mongodb.MovieModel.All() returns an error. 
    Act: Invoke the all() function.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that app.serverError() function is called with the correct error returned by mongodb.MovieModel.All().
Validation:
    The assertion has been chosen to ensure that the app.serverError() function is effectively handling server errors. This test is essential to guarantee that the application behaves correctly under error conditions and aids in diagnosing issues.

Scenario 3: Failed All Request Due to JSON Marshaling Error
Details:
    Description: This test is meant to verify how the all() function handles errors arising from the marshaling of data to JSON.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a successful call to mongodb.MovieModel.All() that returns slice of movies which cause json.Marshal() to return an error.
    Act: Invoke the all() function.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that app.serverError() function is called with the correct error returned by json.Marshal().
Validation:
    The assertion has been chosen to ensure that the app.serverError() function handles marshaling errors correctly. This is a crucial test because failures during JSON marshaling can lead to corrupted data, making it essential to handle such errors correctly. 

Each of the scenarios is equally important as they ensure that the all() function behaves as expected under normal conditions and handles error conditions effectively. This guarantees that the users of the system receive consistent and accurate responses.

This test function loops over the struct slice of test cases and runs each test individually. Each test is unique, handling scenarios such as a valid request, a MongoDB error, or a JSON marshalling error. The application logs are checked to ensure expected messages and error handling callbacks are occurring. The status of the HTTP response and the log output for each case are checked to confirm that the function behaves as expected.
