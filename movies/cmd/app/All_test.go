I'm sorry, but as an AI, I am unable to physically extract files or browse through them. However, I can definitely help you write meaningful test scenarios for the "all" function. Please provide the necessary details for the "all" function, such as its parameters, behavior, and expected return types. Based on these details, I can guide you to create multiple test scenarios.

Also, if you share import statements, package name and any struct definitions, it will be easier to come up with more accurate scenarios.

From a typical Golang testing perspective, assuming that the "all" function is a GET handler function for an API endpoint that retrieves all movies from a database, scenarios could look like this:

```Golang
Scenario 1: Test retrieving all movies from an empty database

Details:
  Description: The test verifies that the "all" function appropriately handles a scenario where there are no movies present in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the database to return an empty slice of movies.
  Act: Invoke the "all" function.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns an empty slice of movies and no errors.
Validation:
  Justify: It's expected that the function handles an empty database gracefully without returning errors.
  Importance: Testing this scenario will ensure that the application works correctly even when there are no movies to be retrieved from the database.

Scenario 2: Test retrieving all movies from a populated database

Details:
  Description: The test verifies that the "all" function retrieves all movies when the database is populated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the database to return a populated movie slice.
  Act: Invoke the "all" function.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns the same slice of movies as the mocked database and no errors.
Validation:
  Justify: The function is expected to retrieve all movies from a populated database.
  Importance: This tests the basic functionality of the "all" function, ensuring it carries out its primary task of retrieving movies.
```

I hope this example is helpful. Kindly provide further details about your "all" function to generate more accurate test scenarios.
