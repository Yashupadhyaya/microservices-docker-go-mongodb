As a professional Go developer without access to file extraction capabilities in this current environment, I will still proceed to outline potential test scenarios for a function named "all". This function theoretically would belong to the "app" package (found at microservices-docker-go-mongodb/movies/cmd/app). 

Please note, these scenarios are conceptual and don't necessarily reflect the exact functionality of the 'All' function as we're unable to inspect the package and the function to come up with a more precise set of test scenarios. BUT it should still guide setting up meaningful test cases in your environment. 

Here are the scenarios:

```
Scenario 1: Successful Fetch of Records
  
Details:
  Description: Test examines 'all' function that should retrieve all records from a MongoDB collection.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the database layer to simulate a collection of movie records within a MongoDB database.
  Act: Invoke `all()` function.
  Assert: Use Go's testing assertions to verify that the returned data matches our mocked database entries.
Validation:
  Justify: Since we mock the database entries, we expect the function to return identical records, verifying its effectiveness.
  Importance: Ensures base functionality of data retrieval works correctly.

Scenario 2: No Records Present

Details:
  Description: Test 'all' function behavior when no records are present in the collection.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the database layer to simulate an empty MongoDB collection.
  Act: Invoke `all()` function.
  Assert: Use Go's testing assertions to verify that the function returns an empty slice, signifying no records.
Validation:
  Justify: When there are no records, the function should return an empty list, showing it properly handles this situation.
  Importance: Validates function's ability to handle edge-case of no existing records.

Scenario 3: Testing Error Handling

Details:
  Description: Verify the 'all' function's error handling mechanism when database functionality encounters an error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the database layer to trigger an error when trying to fetch records (e.g. due to disconnection).
  Act: Invoke `all()` function.
  Assert: Use Go's testing assertions to check that the function gracefully handles the error, either by returning an error or proper handling.
Validation:
  Justify: Error handling is vital for any function interacting with external systems like databases. This checks the function's robustness.
  Importance: Helps ensure resilience of the application against database issues and provide meaningful error messages.
``` 

These scenarios cover average use-case, an edge-case, and error handling. Modify these based on actual function definition and business requirements. Use "github.com/stretchr/testify" or similar package for assertions in your tests to make your tests more readable and easier to write.
