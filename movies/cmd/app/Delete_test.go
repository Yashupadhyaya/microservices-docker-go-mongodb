```
Scenario 1: Successful Deletion of Movie

Details:
  Description: This scenario is testing the delete function when a movie with the provided ID exists in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock database and a movie with a specific ID. Mock the "Delete" method to return a successful response. Initialize the application struct with this mock db.
  Act: Invoke the delete function with the request payload containing the movie's ID.
  Assert: Check that the returned HTTP response has a status code of 200, and "Delete" method of movies was called exactly once with the correct ID.
Validation:
  The assertion is checking that the function worked as expected by deleting the movie from the database. The removed count in the info log and the status code of the response will confirm this. It's an important business requirement to handle movie deletions as it maintains the integrity and accuracy of data.

Scenario 2: Movie Does Not Exist

Details:
  Description: This scenario tests the delete function when a movie with the provided ID does not exist in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock database that will return zero as deleted count for the Delete method. Initialize the application struct with this mock.
  Act: Invoke the delete function with the request payload containing an ID that does not exist.
  Assert: Check that the returned HTTP response has a status code of 404 (Not Found), and delete method of movies was called exactly once with the correct ID.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly handles non-existent movie IDs by returning an appropriate HTTP status code. It is crucial for the API to adequately inform the invoking side about non-existing resources.

Scenario 3: Delete Method Errors Out

Details:
  Description: This scenario is testing the delete function when an error occurs in the Delete method (for instance, database operation error).
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the "Delete" method to automatically return an error, irrespective of inputs provided. Initialize the application struct with this mock.
  Act: Invoke the delete function with any valid ID.
  Assert: Verify that the error log called exactly once, and http response status code is 500.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the function can correctly handle exceptions that may occur during the deletion process by logging an error message and returning a server error status code. This scenario is crucial to ensure system stability in case of database errors or operational issues.
```

NOTE: Writing actual Go Test code is not needed according to the prompt. The above scenarios demonstrate how tests for the delete function may be formulated, but do not contain goverifiable executable test code. The application struct needs to define the serverError method and a struct definition for mongodb.MovieModel is required to fully implement these scenarios.
