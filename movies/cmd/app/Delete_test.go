Based on the provided contents from the `movies/cmd/app/handlers.go` file, I have extracted information about the `delete` function to create relevant testing scenarios for this functionality.

### Scenario 1: Successful Movie Deletion

**Details:**
  Description: This scenario tests the `delete` function to verify if it successfully performs a deletion of a movie by its ID, reflecting proper interaction with the database and subsequent response handling.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the dependent `app.movies.Delete(id)` function to return a success message with a deleted count of 1 and no errors.
  Act: Call the `delete` function with a valid movie ID.
  Assert: Use assertions to verify that the correct status and response messages are logged and returned by the handler.
Validation:
  Justify: Given the mocked database interaction is setup to return that one movie was deleted, the function should log the correct information and not produce any errors.
  Importance: This test ensures the function processes and reflects successful deletions appropriately, crucial for maintaining accurate data in database-driven applications.

### Scenario 2: Deletion With Non-Existent Movie ID

**Details:**
  Description: This scenario examines the function's response when attempting to delete a movie ID that does not exist in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `app.movies.Delete(id)` function to simulate a situation where no movie is found for deletion (e.g., deleted count of 0).
  Act: Invoke the `delete` function with a non-existent movie ID.
  Assert: Assert that the appropriate log message is generated that indicates no movies were deleted.
Validation:
  Justify: The function's reliance on the `DeletedCount` field helps determine the number of deletions occurred. No deletion should lead to a specific logging.
  Importance: Essential for ensuring the function handles cases smoothly where deletions are attempted on non-existent entities, preventing misleading or erroneous client responses.

### Scenario 3: Database Error During Deletion

**Details:**
  Description: Testing the `delete` function's robustness in handling database errors during the deletion process.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `app.movies.Delete(id)` to return an error, simulating a database failure.
  Act: Invoke the `delete` function with a valid movie ID.
  Assert: Assert that the error is logged appropriately and that the server error handler is invoked.
Validation:
  Justify: The scenario validates the function's error handling capabilities, which is critical for reliability and user feedback in production environments.
  Importance: Ensures that the application appropriately handles database errors, providing correct feedback to users and avoiding crashes or undefined behaviors. 

These tests would typically be written in Go using the `testing` framework, possibly with the help of testing packages like `testify` for mocks and assertions, encapsulating each scenario as a test function within a test file corresponding to the `handlers.go` module.
