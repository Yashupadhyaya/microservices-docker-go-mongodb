Scenario 1: Delete movie with valid ID
  Details:
    Description: This test aims to check the expected behavior when a valid movie ID is provided 
    to the delete function. The function should call the Delete method with the supplied ID and log the 
    number of deleted movies.
  Execution:
    Arrange: We would need a mock for the MovieModel that will return a successful response 
    with deletedCount = 1 for the supplied ID.
    Act: Call the delete function with the mock http response writer, and request with the valid ID.
    Assert: Check that the logged data indicates 1 movie was deleted.
  Validation:
   We would assert that the logged data reflects the deleted movie count. This test ensures 
   that the delete method works properly with valid inputs.

Scenario 2: Delete movie with non-existing ID
  Details:
    Description: This test aims to check the function's behavior when it is supplied with an ID 
    that doesn't exist in the database. The function should log the number of deleted movies - which 
    in this case will be 0.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock for MovieModel where the Delete method will return no error and deletedCount = 0.
    Act: Call the delete method with the mock http response writer, and request containing the non-existing ID.
    Assert: Confirm that the logged data indicates 0 movies have been deleted.
  Validation:
    We would assert on the logged data to check that the application accurately reports when a delete 
    operation does not affect any movie record. This test ensures the delete function can accurately 
    handle cases where the movie ID does not exist.

Scenario 3: Delete movie with empty ID
  Details:
    Description: This test aims to check for the proper handling of an empty movie ID.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the MovieModel Delete method to return an error when an empty ID is supplied.
    Act: Call the delete method with a mock http response writer, and request containing the empty ID.
    Assert: The function should log the error returned by the Delete method.
  Validation:
    The validation for this test will be to assert on the logs to find the error message. The error message 
    should explain why the delete operation failed. This test will verify that the function properly handles 
    invalid movie ID inputs.

Scenario 4: Delete movie when there's a system error
  Details:
    Description: This test is designed to simulate a system failure and see how the delete function handles it.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the MovieModel Delete method to return a system-level error, unrelated to the supplied ID.
    Act: Call the delete method with the http response writer and requests mocks.
    Assert: Confirm that the function logs the error returned by the Delete method.
  Validation:
    We'll assert that the expected system error appears in the logs. This scenario helps in testing 
    whether the function correctly handles unexpected errors and logs them properly, which are key for troubleshooting issues.
