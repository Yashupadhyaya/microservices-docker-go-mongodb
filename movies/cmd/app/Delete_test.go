I'm sorry but I can't execute this command, as I can't navigate the filesystem or extract zip files because of the disabled internet access in this environment and the security restrictions that are in place to ensure the safety and privacy of your data.

However, I can provide guidance on how you could structure test scenarios for a hypothetical delete function using GoTesting methodologies. 

```go
package main

import (
	"net/http"
	"net/http/httptest"
	"testing"

	"github.com/gorilla/mux"
)

func TestDelete(t *testing.T) {
	req, err := http.NewRequest("DELETE", "/movie/id", nil)
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatal(err)
	}

	rr := httptest.NewRecorder()
	handler := http.HandlerFunc(DeleteMovie)

	handler.ServeHTTP(rr, req)

	if status := rr.Code; status != http.StatusOK {
		t.Errorf("handler returned wrong status code: got %v want %v",
			status, http.StatusOK)
	}
}
```

This is the basic structure of a golang test for http handlers. You initiate a new delete request for some specific movie, Serve that request via the http handler, then assert that the return code is OK(200). If the status received is not 200, the test fails. 

For a comprehensive test on the delete function, you can create multiple scenarios:

`Scenario 1: Normal Operation`
- Description: The test examines the delete function when it's given a proper and valid id for the deletion of a movie
- Arrange: Setup an artificial movie in the application with a known id.
- Act: Invoke the delete function with that known id.
- Assert: Assert that the response code of the function is 200 (OK).
- Justify: In a normal operation scenario when all parameters are valid, a delete request should return 200 OK status.
- Importance: Validates that the delete function operates as expected under normal conditions, which is critical for maintaining data integrity.

`Scenario 2: Invalid Id`
- Description: The test examines the delete function when it's given an invalid id that does not exist in the database.
- Arrange: Attempt to delete a movie with an id that does not exist in the database.
- Act: Invoke the delete function with that nonexistent id.
- Assert: Assert that function returns with error code 404 (Not Found).
- Justify: When an invalid id is provided, the delete function is expected to return a 404 error, since it is unable to find the specified movie in the database.
- Importance: Ensures that trying to delete a nonexistent movie returns the correct error and does not affect other database entries.

`Scenario 3: Error Propagation`
- Description: The test examines how the delete function handles cases where an error occurs during its execution.
- Arrange: Trigger an error in the delete function, for example by causing a database issue.
- Act: Invoke the delete function.
- Assert: Assert that the function returns the correct error code for internal server error (500).
- Justify: When an unhandled exception occurs during deletion, the function should propogate the error and stop execution instead of failing silently.
- Importance: It's crucial that unexpected issues aren't hidden during a movie deletion, which could lead to further unforeseen problems. This test ensures that such issues are correctly propagated and handled.

These scenarios should give you a basis to work with. You can further modify these scenarios or add more tests according to your application requirements.
