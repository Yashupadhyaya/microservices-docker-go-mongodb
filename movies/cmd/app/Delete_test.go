Based on the provided `handlers.go` from the zip file, the `delete` function in the `main` package has been analyzed. Below, I provide several key Golang testing scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Successful Movie Deletion

Details:
  Description: Ensure the `delete` function successfully deletes a movie by a given ID and logs the deletion count.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock movie storage with a movie that has a specified ID.
  Act: Invoke `delete` method with an HTTP request containing the movie ID.
  Assert: Confirm that the response status is okay without errors, and the log contains a deletion success message.
Validation:
  Justify: The deleted movie should no longer exist in the database, validating the movie's correct deletion.
  Importance: Ensuring reliability and correctness of the delete functionality complies with data management standards.

### Scenario 2: Attempt to Delete Non-existing Movie

Details:
  Description: Test the `delete` function behavior when attempting to delete a movie ID that does not exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock movie storage with some movies but none matching the delete request ID.
  Act: Invoke `delete` method with a non-existing ID.
  Assert: Confirm that the function handles the situation without crashing and an appropriate log message or error is returned.
Validation:
  Justify: Correct error handling ensures the system's robustness and provides clear feedback on unsuccessful operations.
  Importance: Prevents data corruption or illegitimate state changes, maintaining system integrity.

### Scenario 3: Error Handling in Deletion Process

Details:
  Description: Verify that the `delete` function correctly handles database errors during the deletion process.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure the movie storage mock to throw an error when the delete operation is attempted.
  Act: Run the `delete` function with any movie ID.
  Assert: Check for the internal server error response and appropriate logging of the failure.
Validation:
  Justify: Proper error management ensures that system disturbances are handled gracefully, preventing crashes.
  Importance: Critical for maintaining uptime and reliability under unexpected failures.

Each of these test scenarios leverages the functionâ€™s dependencies and behavior as expressed in the source code, utilizing mocks for the movies storage layer, HTTP requests, and logs to ensure comprehensive testing coverage.
