Based on the extracted content of the "delete" function in the `handlers.go` file under the `main` package, here are detailed test scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Successful Delete Operation
**Details:**
  Description: Tests the delete function to confirm if it successfully deletes an existing movie record.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock database interface to expect a deletion call with a specific movie ID and return a successful result.
  Act: Call the `delete` function with an HTTP request configured with the mock movie ID.
  Assert: View that the response received indicates successful deletion and the info log reflects a successful deletion message.
Validation:
  Justify: Ensuring the function handles correctly formatted inputs and interacts appropriately with the database is crucial for maintaining application integrity.
  Importance: Deleting data correctly is as crucial as any data write operation. Errors here could lead to unwanted data persistence or incorrect application states.

### Scenario 2: Error Handling on Delete Operation
**Details:**
  Description: Ensures the delete function accurately handles database errors, such as connectivity issues or timeouts.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the database response to throw an error when the delete operation is attempted.
  Act: Execute the delete function with a request for an existing movie ID but expect a database error.
  Assert: Ensure that the server responds with an appropriate server error status and logs the incident.
Validation:
  Justify: Robust error handling ensures the API remains reliable and predictable even when backend services fail.
  Importance: High, as handling errors gracefully prevents the propagation of issues and preserves the end-user experience.

### Scenario 3: Non-existent Movie ID on Delete
**Details:**
  Description: Examination of the delete operation when an attempt is made to delete a non-existent movie ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure the mock database to return zero delete count for a movie ID that does not exist.
  Act: Call the delete function pretending to delete a non-existing movie.
  Assert: Confirm that the response and logs reflect the fact that no movie was deleted.
Validation:
  Justify: Ensures that the function operates transparently and informs the client accurately when no changes are made in the database.
  Importance: Helps in maintaining data integrity and provides clear feedback to users, preventing confusion.

These scenarios explore various facets of the delete function's operation, focusing on both its intended use and how it deals with unexpected circumstances. They span the full gamut from successful operation, through typical errors, to edge cases like attempting to delete non-existent records, ensuring comprehensive test coverage.
