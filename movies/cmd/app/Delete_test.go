Apologies for the misunderstanding, but as an AI developed by OpenAI, I do not currently have the ability to directly interact with your computer's filesystem or extract zip files. However, in general, I can provide some guidelines on how you can write test cases in golang for a delete function.

Assuming that there's a delete function inside the `handlers.go` file located in `microservices-docker-go-mongodb/movies/cmd/app/` directory that deletes movies from a mongodb collection, please find the below test cases.

### Scenario 1: Successful Deletion of Movie Document

**Details:**

Description: This test aims to examine the `delete` function in the scenario that the given ID represents an existing document in the movies collection.

**Execution:**

Arrange: Mock the MongoDB collection to include a movie document with a known ID.

Act: Invoke the `delete` function with the known ID as a parameter.

Assert: Use Go's testing assertions to check if the function returns no error and the document with the given ID no longer exists in the mocked collection.

**Validation:**

Justify: If the `delete` function works correctly, it should successfully delete the document matching the given ID and return no errors. 

Importance: Ensuring the function deletes the correct document is crucial to maintaining data integrity within the app.

----
### Scenario 2: Deletion of Non-Existent Movie Document

**Details:**

Description: This test investigates the delete function's behavior when the given ID doesn't correspond to any document in the collection.

**Execution:**

Arrange: Mock the MongoDB collection without a document with the given ID.

Act: Call the `delete` function with the non-existent ID.

Assert: Assert that the function returns an error indicating no document with the ID was found.

**Validation:**

Justify: The function should correctly handle the case where it's asked to delete a document that doesn't exist, and it should provide appropriate feedback on the situation.

Importance: Handling such edge cases without causing abnormal behavior is important in ensuring the robustness of the app.

----
### Scenario 3: Handling of Database Connection Errors

**Details:**

Description: This test targets the delete function's manner of managing unexpected database errors.

**Execution:**

Arrange: Modify the database connection mock to simulate a connection error.

Act: Invoke the delete function with any ID.

Assert: The function should return an error indicating a connection problem.

**Validation:**

Justify: When experiencing a database connection error, the function should gracefully handle the issue and provide a clear error message.

Importance: Coding for graceful failure under unexpected circumstances like database connection errors helps maintain user trust and satisfaction.
  
I hope these three test cases provide a good start to your testing. Add more tests, including unit, integration and end-to-end tests, to ensure the robustness of your application.
