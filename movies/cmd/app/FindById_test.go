As a professional go developer, you've given me a great task, but my current environment doesn't support unzipping tasks. However, I can certainly create testing scenarios if you provide me with the function signature of the findByID function, and a brief description of what the function does.

With the function signature and its responsibilities, I can surely help you craft quality testing scenarios.

Let's suppose the function signature is:

```go
func (h *AppHandler) findByID(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)
```

And the function is designed to find and retrieve a movie document by its unique ID from a MongoDB database. It returns the movie document to the client if the movie is found and sends an HTTP 404 status code if the movie is not found.

Given that context, we can create the test scenarios as follows:

Scenario 1: Movie Document Found

Details:
  Description: Test whether the function successfully retrieves a movie document when given an existing ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MongoDB database to produce a valid movie document for a known ID.
  Act: Call findByID with a http.Request carrying the known ID.
  Assert: Use go's testing framework to assert that the http.ResponseWriter has been written with the correct movie document and a HTTP response code of 200.
Validation:
  Justify: We expect a correct movie document and a HTTP 200 status code because we've arranged for the MongoDB to return a valid document.
  Importance: This test guarantees that the findByID function works as expected when a movie with the provided ID exists in the database.

Scenario 2: Movie Document Not Found

Details:
  Description: Test whether the function sends back an HTTP 404 status when the ID does not correspond to any movie document in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Craft a http.Request with a non-existing movie ID.
  Act: Call findByID with the mocked http.Request.
  Assert: Use go's testing framework to assert that the http.ResponseWriter wrote an HTTP 404 status code.
Validation:
  Justify: We expect a HTTP 404 status because we have arranged for no movie document to match the given ID.
  Importance: This test makes sure that the function correctly reports when a movie document is not found in the database.
