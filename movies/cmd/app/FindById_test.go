I can't directly open or extract files because the current environment doesn't support file handling to that extent. However, based on general good practices for Go testing, I can outline several test scenarios for the function "findByID". You can adapt these to the specific use case of the "findByID" function in your Go program, based on its package, imports, and struct definitions.

```
Scenario 1: Successful Retrieval of data by ID

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the findByID function can successfully retrieve the correct data when given a valid ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the data source method to return a particular object for a given ID.
  Act: Call findByID with that specific ID.
  Assert: Use Go's testing package to assert that the returned data matches the expected object.
Validation:
  Justify: This test verifies that findByID is correctly retrieving data for standard inputs, which is its primary function.
  Importance: Correct functionality of findByID is crucial to the operation of the overall application, since it's likely used for retrieving data in various places.

Scenario 2: Handling of non-existent ID

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the findByID function correctly handles a situation where the specified ID does not exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the data source method to return a "not found" result for a particular non-existent ID.
  Act: Call findByID with that non-existent ID.
  Assert: Use the Go's testing framework to assert that the appropriate error message or error code is returned.
Validation:
  Justify: Any function that retrieves data should be able to handle a situation where that data doesn't exist. By returning an appropriate error, findByID can signal to the caller that the ID was not found.
  Importance: Robust error handling is crucial to the robustness of the application. By responding correctly to non-existent IDs, findByID can prevent application crashes and other undesirable behaviour.

Scenario 3: Handling of invalid input

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the findByID function correctly handles a situation where the input is not a valid ID (e.g., it might be the wrong type, or perhaps it's not properly formatted).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement is necessary for this test.
  Act: Call findByID with an invalid ID input.
  Assert: Use the Go's testing framework to assert that the appropriate error message or error code is returned.
Validation:
  Justify: This test validates that findByID can handle invalid inputs safely, without causing crashes, exceptions, or incorrect behaviour.
  Importance: It's important for findByID to respond appropriately to invalid inputs as this is a basic requirement for all functions â€“ it contributes to the robustness and security of the application.
